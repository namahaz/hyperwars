<p>On December 15, 2023, Al Jazeera journalist and Belgian national <strong>Samer Abu Daqqa</strong> was injured from an Israeli drone strike and subsequently died. Ambulances were prevented from reaching Samer for over 5 hours.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Qanan, an al-Ghad reporter described the attack as a direct targeting. “The first missile hit Samer and he tried to crawl for 200 metres, but the Israeli warplanes hit him again and directly, so he became a martyr and his body was cut into pieces.“ His colleague <strong>Wael Dahdouh</strong> who was also struck in the attack said after he got into an ambulance, &quot;I asked them to go back to where I was because Samer was still there and he was screaming and he was calling for help.&quot; Unconfirmed reports initially indicated that sniper drones prevented paramedics from reaching Samer.</p>
<p>There are a few drones and UAVs in operation. Based on Qanan's description of a warplane we might assume this refers to a UAV. If this drone returned for a second strike on the injured reporter, it points to an IDF armed drone squadron. One such publicized group is Squadron 161 known as &quot;Black Snake&quot; and are known to operate Elbit Systems Hermes-450. Such armed operations in dense populated areas as reported by an anonymized Major, &quot;are controlled from a two-man station in the base, with a mission commander and an operator seated side-by-side watching the data transmitted by the UAV.&quot;</p>
<p>The Major goes on to add, &quot;We are capable of the real-time sensor-to-shooter operations, and this is enabled by the accurate intelligence gathered by the UAVs payload combined with additional details that we receive from other sources.&quot; The Major stressed that once a mission commander approves a mission, &quot;there is a man in the loop all the time so that the mission can be aborted,&quot; aborted if there is danger to civilians and presumably humanitarian workers and visibly outfitted journalists. Other specifications and characteristics of the Hermes-450 drone are it's payload capacity of 180kg and it's loud internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>Hyperwars is seeking verification and tips on the nature drone, ordinance and strike. While there is a possibly of other data sources leading to the strike, we are first seeking to narrow the kind of drone strike.</p>
