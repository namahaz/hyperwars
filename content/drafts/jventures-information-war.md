On December 7th, 2023, Jack Paulson and Lee Fang  released WhatsApp and Zoom leaks showing individuals tied to J Ventures willfully consipring to act and causing others to act in the United States as agents of a foreign principal, the Israel Defence Force to wit, without prior registration under the United States Foreign Agent Registration Act.

> We have obtained access to thousands of the group’s WhatsApp messages dating back to mid-October, and an intricate spreadsheet where group participants request and claim tasks ranging from social media responses to IDF support shipments. Separately, we have viewed a number of video meetings charting best practices for “hasbara” –-- an Israeli term of art for “public diplomacy” whose detractors see it as a euphemism for propaganda -- that offer a window into Israel’s public-relations war that is not limited to the tech sector. **Inside the Pro-Israel Information War.
