# "Inside the Pro-Israel Information War"[^1]

On December 7th, 2023, Jack Paulson and Lee Fang  released WhatsApp and Zoom leaks showing individuals tied to J Ventures willfully consipring to act and causing others to act in the United States as agents of a foreign principal, the Israel Defence Force to wit, without prior registration under the United States Foreign Agent Registration Act.

> We have obtained access to thousands of the group’s WhatsApp messages dating back to mid-October, and an intricate spreadsheet where group participants request and claim tasks ranging from social media responses to IDF support shipments. Separately, we have viewed a number of video meetings charting best practices for “hasbara” –-- an Israeli term of art for “public diplomacy” whose detractors see it as a euphemism for propaganda -- that offer a window into Israel’s public-relations war that is not limited to the tech sector.

# Letter to the DOJ

### To: fara.public@usdoj.gov
### Subject: Reporting FARA Violations by J Ventures
### Body:

Employees of J Ventures, as disclosed in leaks of WhatsApp and Zoom cache, have been working in close contact with foreign principals since the October 7th start of the Israel-Palestine War.  
  
Based on reporting from Jack Paulson and Lee Fang titled "Inside the Pro-Israel Information War"[^1], members of the WhatsApp "J-Ventures Global Kibbutz Group" under the leadership of Oded Hermoni, Michael Rolnick, Eran Sandhaus, Jim Koshland, Andy Cohen, Stephani Cherrin, David Wagonfeld, Dina Nathusius, Sandy Cardin and Nadav Ben-Chanoch with support from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, have on advice of Israeli Defense Force principals, carried out operations to:  
  
- Retaliate against employees  
- Hound Israel critics  
- Cancel congresspersons speaking engagements  
- Moderate and censor of social and visual media  
- Blacklist academia and students  
- Smear nonprofits and journalists; and  
- Attempt to ship military-grade equipment abroad  
  
I am asking for a thorough investigation into whether the following persons named in this report knowingly and willfully conspired to act and cause others to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign principal without prior registration under the Foreign Agent Registration Act.
